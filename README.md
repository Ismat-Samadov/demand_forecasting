# Artificial Intelligence in Demand Forecasting
**Improving Accuracy and Reducing Supply Chain Costs**

## üìò Project Overview

This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning models, can be leveraged to improve demand forecasting accuracy and reduce supply chain costs. Demand forecasting plays a critical role in modern supply chain management by enabling businesses to better plan for inventory, logistics, and customer satisfaction.

Traditional methods often fall short in environments with high variability, promotions, seasonality, or limited historical data. This project uses real-world datasets and state-of-the-art AI techniques to demonstrate practical forecasting solutions.

## üîç Objectives

- Evaluate and compare traditional and AI-based demand forecasting models.
- Quantify the impact of AI forecasting on inventory and logistics cost.
- Apply machine learning and deep learning algorithms to real-world retail datasets.
- Explore real-time and hierarchical forecasting techniques using AI.
